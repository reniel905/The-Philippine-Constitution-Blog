                <p class="card-text">The Philippine Constitution, adopted on February 2, 1987,
                    is a crucial document in the Philippine history,
                    it represents the culmination of efforts to restore
                    democracy after years of authoritarian rule under President Ferdinand Marcos.
                    The previous constitution, the 1973 Constitution, had been in effect during the
                    martial law era, and the push for a new constitution emerged as a response to the
                    desire for political reform and the restoration of democratic principles.
                    The 1987 Constitution was the result of a Constitutional Commission appointed
                    by then-President Corazon Aquino, who assumed the office after the People Power Revolution of 1986.
                    The commission, composed of representatives from various sectors, worked to draft a constitution that
                    would embody the values of democracy, human rights, and social justice. The process was characterized by
                    a commitment to inclusivity and a recognition of the need to address historical injustices.</p>

                        It was the first constitution of the Philippines and the first republican constitution in Asia. It was drafted in Malolos. Bulacan by the Malolos congress was approved on January 21, 1899.  The constitution was kind of like a contract between the government and the people, saying what the government could and could not do, and how the people would choose their leaders. It was a big deal since this was the first time the Philippines had its own constitution, making it a truly independent nation.                     </div>

                        It served the Philippines well for many years, but it was eventually replaced with a new one in 1973. However, it remains an important part of Philippine history and a reminder of the country’s journey to independence and self-government.  The 1935 Constitution was like a big rule book for the Philippines before they got full independence from the US. It was written by Filipinos to set up a government that would work for everyone and help the country grow. It is based on American laws, but it had some unique trait that were important to the Filipino people.

                        Made and ratified by the Filipinos during the Marcos Period. The 1973 Constitution established the Philippines as democratic and republican state, with a presidential system of government. It provided for a separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, and it guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press. In addition to its provisions for government structure, the 1973 Constitution also included a bill of rights that guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens. It also provided for the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children. Overall, the 1973 Constitution of the Philippines was a significant document that established the country’s democratic system of government and guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens. It has been amended several times over the years to reflect the changing needs and aspirations of the Filipino people.                    </div>

                        The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, ratified on February 2, 1987, replaced the 1973 Constitution and embodies democratic principles, human rights, and the rule of law.

                <h2>Is the Philippines the only country who had many constitutions?</h2>
                <p>The Philippines had a unique history with multiple constitutions, but it is not the only country to have multiple constitutions. Many countries had multiple constitutions throughout their history, each with its own unique reasons and circumstances. For example, Germany had several constitutions throughout its history, including the Weimar Constitution in 1919, and the Basic Law in 1949. Similarly, Japan had multiple constitutions, including the Meiji Constitution in 1889 and the post-World War II Constitution in 1947. Other countries, such as France, Italy, and Spain, have also had multiple constitutions at different points in their histories.</p>
                <p>One reason is when big things happen, like wars or gaining freedom, countries might need new rules to fit the new situation. Also, if there are changes in who's leading or how the government works, they might decide to make a new rulebook. As time goes on, societies change, and people's needs and expectations evolve. So, countries update their rules to make sure they still match what people want. They might also change the rules to fix problems they're facing, like corruption or not enough protection for people's rights. Sometimes, what's happening in the world or how the economy is working can also lead to changes in the rules. The Philippines, like other countries, has changed its rules because of a mix of these reasons, wanting to make sure their rules stay in sync with what people need and value.</p>
                <p>So, in the end, the Philippines has had different sets of rules because of many reasons like changes in how the government works, conflicts, and the influence of other countries. Each set of rules, called a constitution, shows what the Filipino people needed and wanted at different times. These rules played a big role in how the country grew in politics, society, and the economy. Overall, the Philippines has been figuring out the best way to have rules that match what its people need and dream about.</p>
                <h2>Why had Philippines always changed its constitution?</h2>
                <p>The Philippines has always changed its constitution for a various kind of reason, including political, economic, and social ones. One of the reasons for these changes is the country’s desire to address particular issues or adapt to its changing circumstances. These changes often reflect the nation’s effort to address problems with its political system, societal demand, and governance. Historical events and changes in the country’s leadership have also influenced the necessity for constitutional modification in the Philippines. Political decentralization, economic prosperity, and the settlement of human rights issues have all contributed the desire to change in the Philippines constitution.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, the rules in the Philippines' constitution change because of how the government works. This can happen when there are new leaders, shifts in power, or a desire for a more stable political situation. They might also change the rules to address past issues, fix problems, or follow international standards for how countries should be run.</p>
                <p>The Philippines has experienced different types of leadership, including times of martial law, which affects discussions about changing the constitution. People often want changes to make the government more inclusive and responsive to everyone's needs.</p>
                <p>Yet, how often they change the constitution is a debated topic. Some think it's better to keep a consistent set of rules for a strong and continuous government. Finding the right balance between making necessary updates and having a reliable foundation is a challenging task for the Philippines, similar to other countries.</p>
                <p>In general, the Philippines constitution has been changed to address a variety of concerns, such as political decentralization, economic growth, human rights, and governance. Events in history, changes in the country's requirements throughout time, and leadership changes have all had an impact on these developments.</p>
